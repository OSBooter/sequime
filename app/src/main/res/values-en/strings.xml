	<string name=  "txt_ayuda_opciones">You will see that it is not so so complicated, you have the following options: \n
	\n

	SMS: \n
	It is a phone number that you can choose for the application to send coordinates by SMS. \n
	SMS will only be sent if the tracking option is enabled. \n
	To avoid expenses I recommend not using this option if you are using the Seguime server, use this option only if you are using your own server, or a secure server \n
	\n
	Telegram ID: \n
	is a number identifier of Telegram, is not the @ID_USUARIO, to use this option visit the bot @seguimebot and greet it, will give you your ID number, then with that number the bot can send coordinates to that account Telegram. \n
	\n
	Activity range: \n
	During this period the application will be working completely, locating coordinates and making connections to Internet, a very small value may not achieve coordinates if you have little GPS coverage, a very high value can consume a lot of battery \n
	For the application to be constantly on (and not for time intervals) set any time interval to 0 (zero) \n
	\n
	Idle interval: \n
	During this period the application will be resting, do not make Internet connections or locate coordinates, a rest is used to save battery, a very small value may consume a lot of battery, a very high value will hinder the purpose of the Application \n
	For the application to be constantly on (and not for time intervals) set any time interval to 0 (zero) \n
	\n
	Tracking: \n
	When this option is enabled the application will send messages by Telegram and SMS each time you find a new coordinate. This option can be enabled from the Web site therefore for your security and to avoid expenses do not configure SMS unless you are using your own server \n
	\n
	\n
	I hope you can use this help
